# Task Difficulty Breakdown System Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a structured task difficulty breakdown system with centralized knowledge base for high-difficulty issues in the AI Psychologist project.

## Phase 1: Task Difficulty Classification Framework
1. **Create difficulty classification criteria** (`docs/TASK_DIFFICULTY_GUIDELINES.md`)
   - Define Low/Medium/High difficulty criteria
   - Technical requirements assessment
   - Dependencies evaluation
   - Time estimation guidelines

2. **Create task tracking structure** (`.trae/tasks/`)
   - Task template with difficulty metadata
   - Task categorization system
   - Priority mapping to difficulty levels

## Phase 2: High-Difficulty Issue Documentation System
3. **Create issue documentation template** (`docs/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`)
   - Problem description with reproduction steps
   - Technical analysis of root causes
   - Implemented solution with code references
   - Alternative approaches considered
   - Prevention measures

4. **Create knowledge base structure** (`knowledge-base/`)
   - Organized by module (emotion, assessment, chat, etc.)
   - Indexed by difficulty level
   - Searchable metadata

## Phase 3: Integration & Automation
5. **Create task management utilities** (`scripts/task_manager.py`)
   - Task creation with difficulty auto-assessment
   - Issue documentation generator
   - Knowledge base indexer

6. **Update development workflow**
   - Integrate with existing pytest testing
   - Add difficulty tracking to CI/CD
   - Create reporting dashboard

## Phase 4: Documentation & Training
7. **Create usage guide** (`docs/TASK_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md`)
   - How to classify tasks
   - How to document high-difficulty issues
   - How to search knowledge base

8. **Create examples** (`knowledge-base/examples/`)
   - Sample low/medium/high difficulty tasks
   - Sample high-difficulty issue documentation

## Key Deliverables
- Task difficulty classification framework
- High-difficulty issue documentation template
- Centralized knowledge base with indexing
- Automation scripts for task/issue management
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
